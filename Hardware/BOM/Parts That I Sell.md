## Parts I sell, go shoot me an email at waicool20@gmail.com (All prices in USD):

| Part | Price | Usage |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| PCB  | $20 each, $40 for both boards | Well where else are you gonna solder all those parts together? |
| DC-DC converter inductors x2 | $3 | One of these are for the low voltage supply and the other for the high voltage supply |
| HV Safety Capacitors x 4 | $2 | 3 for ornament use and the other one for actual use on the high voltage supply circuit |
| Dummy super capacitor | $.75 | It's the left most capacitor you see on the divergence meter |
| IPB17N25S3-100 | $1 | Once again for the high voltage supply |
| DS3232SN | $7 | Real Time Clock IC for keeping time |
| Other parts | I pretty much have everything else in large amounts like misc resistors, capacitors, switches, battery holders etc. but I think it would cheaper if you just went to a local electronics store. The only things I don't have though are the ICs used in this project except for the the attiny861a. Have to think of a way to program SMD parts first though =__= |

You choose and pay for the shipping (From Hong Kong). Normal mail, speed mail, fedex, ups etc. I think we pretty much have every kind of delivery company here :/ but ehh some of them are crazy expensive.
