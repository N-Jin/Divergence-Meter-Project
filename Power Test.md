#Power Test

People usually say the difference between fooling around and science is writing results down.
So to keep up some of the "scientific spirit", here I present some data that might be useful :)

All test were conducted in Clock Mode. Taking 550mAh as the standard capacity of the 9V Alkaline battery.

| Power Supply | Total Voltage | Current | Watts (VI) | Brightness | Estimated Supply Life |  
|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---------------------:|  
| 2x9V Alkaline Battery(Standard Energizers) | 14.6V | 47.6mA | 0.695 | 0(lowest) | 550/47.6 = 11.6 Hours |  
| 2x9V Alkaline Battery(Standard Energizers) | 14.6V | 126.2mA | 1.84 | 9(lowest) | 550/126.2 = 4.36 Hours |
